# CLI-Portfolio-AHASAS-SINGH
# 🖥️ Terminal Style Portfolio

A fully interactive, retro-themed developer portfolio that simulates an old CRT computer monitor. This project allows users to navigate through my professional details using a Command Line Interface (CLI).

## ✨ Features
* **Retro Aesthetics:** Features CRT scanlines, screen flicker animations, and a glowing text effect.
* **Interactive CLI:** Users type commands to fetch data just like a real terminal.
* **Theme Switcher:** Includes a `theme` command to toggle between "Green" and "Amber" monitor styles.
* **Soundless & Lightweight:** Built as a single file using React and Tailwind via CDN.

## 🚀 Available Commands
Type `help` to see the full list. Key commands include:
* `about`: View bio and principles.
* `skills`: List technical skills (JavaScript, Python, C++, etc.).
* `projects`: See details on projects like the Rock Paper Scissors Game and Simple Calculator.
* `contact`: Display email, phone, and social links.
* `clear`: Clears the terminal history.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **HTML5 & CSS3**
* **React.js** (via Babel Standalone)
* **Tailwind CSS** (for styling)

## 📦 How to Run
This project uses a "Zero Build" approach. You do not need `npm` or `node_modules`.
1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Simply open `index.html` (or `portfolio.html`) in any modern web browser.
